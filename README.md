# Logistic_Regression
Agenda:
1) Introducing the Pima datasetReading in the data
  - Analysing the data
  - Logistic regression

2) Form of Logistic regression
  - Building a Logistic regression model
  - Using the model for prediction
  
3) Evaluation
  - Classification Accuracy
  - Null Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix:
      * Recall(True Positive Rate) - Sensitivty
      * Precision
      * False Positive Rate 
      * specificity
      * Classification Error(Misclassification Rate)
4) Adjusting the classification threshold
  - ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves)
  - AUC (Area Under Curves)
5) Pros/Cons
